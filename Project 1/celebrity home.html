Its follow-up, the dance-pop-influenced Rare (2020), contained her first US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single "Lose You to Love Me". She forayed into Spanish-language music with the EP Revelación (2021), which earned her nominations at the Grammys and Latin Grammy Awards. She has released various collaborative singles throughout her career, including "We Don't Talk Anymore", "It Ain't Me", "Wolves", "Taki Taki", and "Calm Down (Remix)", the last of which is the most commercially successful Afrobeats song of all time.

Gomez is an established actress and television personality. Her films include Another Cinderella Story (2008), Monte Carlo (2011), Spring Breakers (2012), The Fundamentals of Caring (2016), The Dead Don't Die (2019), and Emilia Pérez (2024).

Her accolades include an American Music Award, a Billboard Music Award, a Cannes Film Festival Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, and 16 Guinness World Records.

As a philanthropist, Gomez has worked with charitable organizations. She advocates for mental health, and gender, racial, and LGBT equality, and has been a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2009. She founded the cosmetic company Rare Beauty in 2020, valued at $2 billion in 2024,[2] and the mental-health non-profit Rare Impact Fund. She has appeared in listicles such as the Time 100 (2020) and Forbes 30 Under 30 (2016 and 2020), and was named the Billboard Woman of the Year (2017).

Early life
Selena Marie Gomez was born on July 22, 1992, in Grand Prairie, Texas,[3] to Ricardo Joel Gomez and Texas-born[4] former stage actress Mandy Teefey.[5] She was named after Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla, who died in 1995.[6][7] Her father is of Mexican descent, while her mother, who was adopted, has Italian ancestry.[8][9][10] Gomez's paternal grandparents emigrated to Texas from Monterrey in the 1970s.[11] Of her heritage, Gomez has said she is "a proud third-generation American-Mexican"[12] and "My family does have quinceañeras, and we go to the communion church. We do everything that's Catholic, but we don't really have anything traditional except go to the park and have barbecues on Sundays after church."[13] Gomez's Spanish fluency waned after age seven, when she began working on television.[11] Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she remained with her mother.[5][14] Gomez has two younger half-sisters and a younger stepbrother: Gracie Elliot Teefey, through Mandy and her second husband, Brian Teefey,[15][16] and Victoria "Tori" and Marcus Gomez, through Ricardo and his second wife, Sara.[17] She earned her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2010.[18]

Gomez was born when her mother was 16 years old.[19] The family had financial troubles throughout Gomez's childhood, her mother struggling to provide for the pair. At one point, Gomez recalls that they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car. Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to buy spaghetti for dinner.[20] Gomez has said, "I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas]."[21] She later added that her mother "was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me." Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child and appeared in various pageants. Her grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and she has said they "raised her" until she found success in show business.[22
